# ðŸ¥Œ CurlReq

ðŸ¥Œ ðŸ¥Œ ðŸ¥Œ ðŸ¥Œ ðŸ¥Œ ðŸ¥Œ

Req is awesome, but the world speaks curl.

Next time you're debugging a 3rd party API and need to ask for support, you can just toss in this line:

```elixir
|> CurlReq.inspect()
```

And you'll have the full curl command.

[Read the announcement here](https://codecodeship.com/blog/2024-06-03-curl_req).

## Usage

### Req to Curl

```elixir
# Turn a Req request into a `curl` command.

iex> Req.new(url: "/fact", base_url: "https://example.com/")
...> |> CurlReq.to_curl()
"curl --compressed -X GET https://example.com/fact"

# Or use `CurlReq.inspect/2` to inspect inline.

Req.new(url: "https://example.com")
|> CurlReq.inspect()
|> Req.request!()
#=> curl --compressed -X GET https://example.com
```

### Curl to Req

`CurlReq` also implements the `~CURL` sigil, which converts a curl command to its corresponding Req request.

```elixir
iex> import CurlReq
...> ~CURL(curl https://www.example.com)
...> # |> Req.request!()

```

or use `CurlReq.from_curl/1`:

```elixir
iex> CurlReq.from_curl("curl https://example.com")
...> # |> Req.request!()

```

### Req Plugin

One final feature to note the Req plugin, `CurlReq.Plugin`. Use `CurlReq.Plugin.attach/2` to set up curl logging (inspired by `TeslaCurl`).

```elixir
iex> Req.new(url: "/fact", base_url: "https://example.com/")
...> |> CurlReq.Plugin.attach()
...> # |> Req.request!()

```

## Supported Features

CurlReq parses a bunch of cURL flags and translates them to Req.Request structs and vice versa. To get an up to date list you can call `CurlReq.Curl.flags/0`

### Supported Flags

The following flags are supported in all directions (from Req, from cURL, to Req, to cURL)

| Long           | Short | Limitation                     |
| -------------- | ----- | ------------------------------ |

| `--data_raw`   |       | No file interpolation with `@` |
| `--data_ascii` |       | No file interpolation with `@` |
| `--cookie`     | `-b`  |                                |
| `--head`       | `-I`  |                                |

| `--user`       | `-u`  | Only as basic auth             |
| `--compressed` |       |                                |
| `--proxy`      | `-x`  |                                |
| `--proxy_user` | `-U`  | Only as basic auth             |
| `--netrc`      | `-n`  |                                |
| `--netrc_file` |       |                                |
| `--insecure`   | `-k`  |                                |
| `--user_agent` | `-A`  |                                |
| `--ipv4` | `-4`  | Short form raises                               |
| `--ipv6` | `-6`  | Short form raises                               |

### Ignored flags

The following flags are currently ignored because they mostly describe the runtime behaviour and not the request itself.

| Long            | Short |
| --------------- | ----- |
| `--verbose`     | `-v`  |
| `--output`      | `-o`  |
| `--remote_name` | `-O`  |
| `--show-error`  | `-S`  |
| `--silent`      | `-s`  |
| `--fail`        | `-f`  |

## Installation

The package can be installed
